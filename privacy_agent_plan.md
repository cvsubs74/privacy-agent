# Privacy Regulation Assessment Agent - Design and Implementation Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan to build a privacy agent using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). The agent will assist users in assessing privacy regulations by analyzing online privacy policies against specified principles. The initial version will focus on a simple use case and will be designed to be user-intuitive, with a clear path for future enhancements.

## 2. Core Objective

To create an AI agent that can:
1.  Fetch and process the text of an online privacy policy.
2.  Understand a user-specified privacy regulation principle.
3.  Analyze the policy text for relevance to that principle.
4.  Provide a preliminary, non-legally-binding assessment of how the policy addresses the principle.
5.  Present the findings in a clear, user-friendly format.

## 3. Simple Use Case

*   **User Query:** "Does the privacy policy at [URL] comply with GDPR's 'data minimization' principle?"
*   **Agent Input:**
    *   URL of the privacy policy.
    *   Privacy regulation (e.g., "GDPR").
    *   Specific principle (e.g., "data minimization").
*   **Agent Output:** A report including:
    *   A brief explanation of the specified privacy principle.
    *   Key excerpts from the privacy policy relevant to the principle.
    *   A preliminary assessment (e.g., "Appears to Address," "Partially Addresses," "Does Not Clearly Address").
    *   A brief justification for the assessment.
    *   A clear disclaimer stating this is not legal advice.

## 4. Design and Architecture

Inspired by the multi-agent architecture of ADK samples like `llm-auditor`, the privacy agent will be a `SequentialAgent` composed of several specialized sub-agents.

*   **`PrivacyAssessmentAgent` (Orchestrator - `google.adk.agents.SequentialAgent`)**
    *   Manages the overall workflow.
    *   Takes the initial user query.
    *   Passes data sequentially through its sub-agents.
    *   Collects and formats the final output from the last sub-agent.

*   **Sub-Agents:**

    1.  **`PolicyFetcherAgent`**
        *   **Task:** Retrieve the textual content of the privacy policy from the provided URL.
        *   **Implementation:** This agent will internally use Python libraries like `requests` (for fetching HTML) and `BeautifulSoup4` (for text extraction). It can be a simple ADK `Agent` that wraps this Python logic.
        *   **Input:** Policy URL.
        *   **Output:** Raw text of the privacy policy.

    2.  **`RegulationUnderstandingAgent`**
        *   **Task:** Explain the specified privacy regulation and principle in simple terms.
        *   **Implementation:** An ADK `Agent` configured with an LLM (e.g., Gemini) and a specific prompt.
        *   **Input:** Regulation name (e.g., "GDPR"), principle name (e.g., "data minimization").
        *   **Output:** Textual explanation of the principle.

    3.  **`PolicyAnalyzerAgent`**
        *   **Task:** Identify and extract sections from the privacy policy text that are relevant to the explained principle.
        *   **Implementation:** An ADK `Agent` (LLM-based) with a prompt designed for contextual searching within the policy.
        *   **Input:** Full policy text, explanation of the principle.
        *   **Output:** A list of relevant text snippets/excerpts from the policy.

    4.  **`ComplianceAssessorAgent`**
        *   **Task:** Evaluate the extracted policy snippets against the principle's explanation to provide a preliminary assessment.
        *   **Implementation:** An ADK `Agent` (LLM-based) with a prompt for comparative analysis and assessment.
        *   **Input:** Explanation of the principle, relevant policy snippets.
        *   **Output:** Assessment category (e.g., "Appears to Address") and a brief justification.

    5.  **`ReportGeneratorAgent`**
        *   **Task:** Compile all generated information into a structured, human-readable report.
        *   **Implementation:** Can be a simple ADK `Agent` that formats inputs into a markdown string, or an LLM-based agent for more natural summarization. Will include a standard disclaimer.
        *   **Input:** Outputs from all previous agents (principle explanation, policy snippets, assessment).
        *   **Output:** Final formatted report string.

## 5. Implementation Plan (Step-by-Step)

1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Create project directory: `privacy_agent`.
    *   Initialize Python virtual environment (`venv` or `poetry`).
    *   Install dependencies: `google-adk`, `google-generativeai` (for Gemini), `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `python-dotenv`.
    *   Create `pyproject.toml` (or `requirements.txt`).
    *   Create `.env.example` for API keys (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`).
    *   Create `README.md` for project overview.

2.  **Directory Structure:**

    ├── pyproject.toml
    └── README.md
    ```

3.  **Implement `utils/web_parser.py`:**
    *   Create functions:
        *   `fetch_url_content(url: str) -> str | None`: Fetches HTML.
        *   `extract_text_from_html(html_content: str) -> str`: Extracts clean text.

4.  **Implement `PolicyFetcherAgent` (`sub_agents/policy_fetcher/agent.py`):**
    *   Define an ADK `Agent`.
    *   Its core logic will call the utility functions from `web_parser.py`.
    *   Handle potential errors during fetching/parsing.

5.  **Implement `RegulationUnderstandingAgent` (`sub_agents/regulation_understanding/`):**
    *   `prompt.py`: Define `REGULATION_EXPLAINER_PROMPT`.
        *   Example: "Explain the privacy principle '{principle_name}' under the '{regulation_name}' regulation. Describe its core requirements and what to look for in a privacy policy regarding compliance."
    *   `agent.py`: Define `regulation_understanding_agent` using `google.adk.Agent`, configured with an LLM and the prompt.

6.  **Implement `PolicyAnalyzerAgent` (`sub_agents/policy_analyzer/`):**
    *   `prompt.py`: Define `POLICY_ANALYZER_PROMPT`.
        *   Example: "Given the following privacy principle explanation and the full text of a privacy policy, identify and extract up to 5 key sentences or short paragraphs from the policy that directly address or relate to this principle. If no relevant sections are found, state that clearly.\n\nPrinciple Explanation:\n{principle_explanation}\n\nPolicy Text:\n{policy_text}\n\nRelevant Excerpts:"
    *   `agent.py`: Define `policy_analyzer_agent`.

7.  **Implement `ComplianceAssessorAgent` (`sub_agents/compliance_assessor/`):**
    *   `prompt.py`: Define `COMPLIANCE_ASSESSOR_PROMPT`.
        *   Example: "Based on the privacy principle explanation and the extracted policy snippets below, provide a brief assessment (1-2 sentences) of how well the policy appears to address the principle. Choose one assessment category: 'Appears to Address', 'Partially Addresses', 'Does Not Clearly Address', 'Potentially Contradicts'. This is not legal advice.\n\nPrinciple Explanation:\n{principle_explanation}\n\nPolicy Snippets:\n{policy_snippets}\n\nAssessment Category:\nJustification:"
    *   `agent.py`: Define `compliance_assessor_agent`.

8.  **Implement `ReportGeneratorAgent` (`sub_agents/report_generator/`):**
    *   `agent.py`: Define `report_generator_agent`.
        *   Initially, this can be a simple Python function that takes the structured outputs from previous agents and formats them into a markdown string.
        *   Include a standard disclaimer: "DISCLAIMER: This AI-generated report is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Consult with a qualified legal professional for any legal concerns or decisions."
    *   (Optional) `prompt.py`: If using an LLM for summarization, define a suitable prompt.

9.  **Implement `PrivacyAssessmentAgent` Orchestrator (`privacy_agent/agent.py`):**
    *   Define `privacy_assessment_agent` as a `google.adk.agents.SequentialAgent`.
    *   List the sub-agents in the correct order of execution.
    *   Manage context passing (ADK handles much of this implicitly for sequential agents if inputs/outputs are named consistently or mapped).

10. **Create CLI Runner (`main.py`):**
    *   Use `argparse` for command-line arguments (URL, regulation, principle).
    *   Load environment variables (e.g., using `dotenv`).
    *   Initialize and run the `privacy_assessment_agent`.
    *   Print the final report to the console.

11. **Testing and Iteration:**
    *   Unit test each sub-agent's functionality.
    *   Perform end-to-end testing with various real-world privacy policies and principles.
    *   Refine prompts based on LLM performance and output quality.
    *   Implement robust error handling (network issues, parsing failures, LLM errors).

## 6. Future Enhancements (User Intuitive Focus)

*   **Web Interface:** Develop a simple web UI (e.g., using Streamlit or Flask) for easier interaction than CLI.
*   **Predefined Regulations/Principles:** Offer a dropdown or selection list for common regulations (GDPR, CCPA) and their key principles.
*   **Advanced Text Analysis:** Integrate more sophisticated NLP techniques for deeper policy understanding (e.g., named entity recognition for data types, purpose extraction).
*   **Source Linking:** In the report, link extracted snippets back to their approximate location in the original policy (if feasible).
*   **Caching:** Implement caching for fetched policies and potentially LLM responses to improve speed and reduce costs for repeated queries.
*   **User Feedback Mechanism:** Allow users to rate the usefulness or accuracy of the assessment.
